      <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
      <p>
        We are a volunteer-based nonprofit organization founded in December 2020. Our mission is to guide the residents of
        the 30th ward on how to contest their tickets.

				Most tickets go uncontested, and we aim to educate those in the community with data and help resources about how to to prepare for a successful court case in hopes that late fees and unfair penalties can be avoided.

      <h2>Why Are We Here?</h2>
      <p>
        We are on a mission to help residents of the 30th ward contest and win appeals on parking violations.


				Chicago has a huge problem with unfair parking violation fines and punishment. <a target="_blank" href="https://features.propublica.org/driven-into-debt/chicago-ticket-debt-bankruptcy/">10,000 chapter 13 bankruptcies in 2017 mentioned parking ticket debts, typically around $3,900.</a> These fines typically come in the form of late fees for not paying the original fine, eventually leading to an impossible spiral that can never be paid.
