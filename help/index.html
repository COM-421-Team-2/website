        <h2>Step-by-Step Guide</h2>
        <h3>Phase 1</h3>
        <p>
          When you first see the ticket on your dashboard or get an email about a ticket, there are a few things you should do before considering how you will contest it:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Make sure you take photos of your vehicle and any important scenery the citation mentions.
            <ul>
              <li>For example, if you are cited for parking too close to a fire hydrant, include that in your photos.</li>
              <li>Print out the photo evidence. Courts don’t typically accept digital photos as evidence.</li>
              <li>Gather up any additional information that you think can help your specific situation.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Make sure to move your car to avoid further citations.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Phase 2</h3>

        <p>
          After you gathered this information, you need to make sure you are even able to contest the citation. The city of chicago only allows a few defenses for parking violations, so you need to make sure you can use one of them in your appeal. They are as follows:
        </p>


        <table>
          <!-- define the size of this table -->
          <colgroup>
            <col span="1" style="width: 50%;">
            <col span="1" style="width: 50%;">
         </colgroup>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Legalese <a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/fin/supp_info/revenue/challenging_tickets/contesting_by_mail.html" target="_blank">(source)</a></th>
              <th>English translation</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>

          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>The respondent was not the owner or lessee of the cited vehicle at the time of the violation.</td>
              <td>If you got a ticket and you are not the owner of the car. For example, you just sold the car.</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <td>The cited vehicle or its state registration plates (license plates) were stolen at the time of the violation.</td>
              <td>
                Your car or it’s license plates were stolen when the citation was filed. If someone impersonated you by having your car or plates, you are not liable for the citation.
              </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <td>The relevant signs prohibiting or restricting parking were missing or obscured.</td>
              <td>
                If something that means “NO PARKING” is missing or covered. Ex: someone blocks a fire hydrant with trash bags.
              </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <td>
                The relevant parking meter was inoperable or malfunctioned through no fault of the respondent.
              </td>
              <td>
                Did you just move to chicago or a new neighborhood and are still waiting on the parking tag in the mail? Did you just get a new car and are waiting on the tag?
              </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <td>
                The facts alleged in the parking or compliance violation notice are inconsistent or do not support a finding that the specified regulation was violated (e.g., motorists may contest a city sticker violation if they have resided in Chicago for less than 30 days or the cited vehicle was purchased in the last 30 days; tinted windows comply with the medical use requirement of 625 ILCS 5/12-503(g); the residential parking permit was issued to a delivery, service, or repair vehicle or home health care provider doing business with or assisting a resident of the zone; etc.).
              </td>
              <td>
                Did you just move to chicago or a new neighborhood and are still waiting on the parking tag in the mail? Did you just get a new car and are waiting on the tag?
              </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <td>The illegal vehicle condition did not exist at the time of the compliance violation.
              </td>
              <td>
                If the citation claims something like missing or expired plate numbers, illegal window tints, or the vehicle was damaged, but it was not.
              </td>
            </tr>


            <tr>
              <td>
                The illegal vehicle condition was corrected prior to the hearing (Note: this defense does not apply to city sticker violations (§ 9-64-125), muffler or exhaust violations (§ 9-76-140(a)), missing plate violations (§ 9-76-160(a)), expired registration violations (§ 9-76-160(f)), and tinted window violations (§ 9-76-220)).
              </td>
              <td>
                Did you fix the vehicle condition violation before the hearing?
              </td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>
          If one of these defenses fit your case and you are planning to contest your ticket, follow the steps below to contest it <a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/fin/supp_info/revenue/challenging_tickets/contesting_in_person.html" target="_blank">(source)</a>:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Visit the City of Chicago's website and follow the instructions to <a href="https://erequest.cityofchicago.org/EHearingWeb/home.do" target="_blank">request an in-person hearing.</a></li>
          <li>Print and fill out our appeal template or use it as a base for your appeal. Make sure to practice!</li>
          <li>Once you receive a notice with your scheduled hearing week, choose a date and location.</li>
          <li>Bring the filled out appeal template and any evidence you have to your hearing.</li>
          <li>On your hearing date, you’ll wait in a room to see an administrative law judge, a private and independent attorney. You’ll be on a timer as you present your case, so it's best to be prepared as possible using the template we have provided. Once you’ve argued your case, the decision is usually made on the spot.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          It is important to note that you have seven days to appeal the citation after you receive the ticket.
          If you don’t appeal or pay the ticket within those seven days, you will get a notice of violation in the mail allowing 21 days to request a hearing. The important thing here is promptness.
          If you show up late or forget to apply in time, you will likely lose your appeal and be forced to pay for the citation.
